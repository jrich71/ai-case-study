# Case Study Template to Use/Follow

# TITLE

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company

    - DataSeer (DataSeer Research Data Services Ltd)

* When was the company incorporated?

    - DataSeer was founded in 2019

* Who are the founders of the company?

    - [Tim Vines, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drtimvines/), is the founder and current CEO.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

    - According to its [website](https://dataseer.ai/about/), Dr. Vines conceived DataSeer while manually checking data policy compliance for the journal [Molecular Ecology](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1365294x). Instead of going through each article line-by-line for 30 minutes or more, he wondered, why not have Artificial Intelligence do the same job in seconds?

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

    - DataSeer was initially funded by a grant from the Sloan Foundation. It's unclear yet what other funding sources support the company. Recently, though, DataSeer [partnered with the research publisher, Taylor & Francis](https://dataseer.ai/2024/10/14/taylor-francis-and-dataseer-to-collaborate-in-data-sharing-compliance-checks-and-open-science-metrics-pilots/).

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
    - DataSeer is a small AI and Research Data Services company solving problems from developing "Open Science" solutions. A key problem is accurately and efficiently advising researchers when and how to comply with open data sharing policies with peer-reviewed journal articles. A solution would reduce the time and costs associated with sharing research data as well as catalyze data and knowledge sharing to build an open science ecosystem. 

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

    - DataSeer offers three AI-driven products that enable a more data-driven open science ecosystem, which benefits from enhanced compliance, quality checking, and measurement tools for achieving rigor and incresed impact in research:

        - [Compliance Checks](https://dataseer.ai/compliance-checks/): Using AI to verify whether peer-review manuscripts (and data products?) are aligned with publishing policies. 

        - [Open Science Metrics](https://dataseer.ai/open-science-metrics/): Using NLP to aggregate statistics on a variety of data points that include "open access licensing, data and code sharing, repository use, preprint posting, protocol sharing and reuse, personal identifiers, and more." The statistics can be reported according to different factors (e.g., journal, funder, over time, etc.) and linked back to originating sources (i.e., article and article metadata).

        - [DataSeer SnapShot](https://dataseer.ai/snapshot/): Using AI to determine the degrees to which journal article text describes open science practices and then generate messages to authors as to how they may address any gaps in describing their practices. The results help journal editors more accurately and efficiently quality check and triage articles for publication.

    - In addition to offering products, DataSeer engages in [partnerships](https://dataseer.ai/2020/06/11/coko-receives-sloan-foundation-grant-to-build-dataseer-a-missing-piece-in-the-data-sharing-puzzle/) for promoting open data and knowledge sharing through improved compliance, gaining workflow efficiencies, and achieving more insightful reporting.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?

* What are the other major companies in this field?

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
