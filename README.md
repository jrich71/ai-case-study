# DataSeer: Using AI to Build a Better Open Science Ecosystem

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company

    - DataSeer (DataSeer Research Data Services Ltd)

* When was the company incorporated?

    - [DataSeer](https://dataseer.ai/) was founded in 2019.

* Who are the founders of the company?

    - [Tim Vines, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drtimvines/), is the founder and current CEO.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

    - According to its [website](https://dataseer.ai/about/), Dr. Vines conceived DataSeer while manually checking data policy compliance for the journal [Molecular Ecology](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1365294x). Instead of going through each article line-by-line for 30 minutes or more, he wondered, why not have Artificial Intelligence do the same job in seconds?

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

    - DataSeer was initially funded by a grant from the Sloan Foundation. It's unclear yet what other funding sources support the company. Recently, though, DataSeer has [partnered with the research publisher, Taylor & Francis](https://dataseer.ai/2024/10/14/taylor-francis-and-dataseer-to-collaborate-in-data-sharing-compliance-checks-and-open-science-metrics-pilots/) and [IOP Publishing](https://dataseer.ai/2024/02/26/dataseer-ai-and-iop-publishing-collaborate-on-open-science-indicators-and-open-data-pilot/).

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
    - DataSeer (Vancouver, BC, Canada) is a small AI and Research Data Services company that promotes "Open Science" by [providing](https://dataseer.ai/about/), "low-cost, scalable solutions to measure open science, show researchers how to comply with policy, and deploy just-in-time interventions." A key problem is accurately and efficiently advising researchers when and how to comply with open data sharing policies with peer-reviewed journal articles. A solution would reduce the time and costs associated with sharing research data as well as catalyze data and knowledge sharing to build an open science ecosystem. 

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

    - The field is an intersection of scholarly publishing, research and development, and technology. The scholarly publishing market in 2020 was valued at $26.5 billion of which $9.5 billiion (36%) came from academic journals ([Butler et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00272)). Open Access (OA) alone accounted for almost $1 billion in 2020. The [top 5 OA publishers](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00272) from 2015&ndash;2018 were the following (along with estmated revenue):

        - Springer Nature ($589.7 million)
        - Elsevier ($221.4 million)
        - Wiley ($114.3 million)
        - Taylor & Francis ($76.8 million)
        - Sage ($31.6 million)

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

    - DataSeer offers three AI-driven products that enable a more data-driven open science ecosystem, which benefits from enhanced compliance, quality checking, and measurement tools for achieving rigor and incresed impact in research:

        - [Compliance Checks](https://dataseer.ai/compliance-checks/): Using AI to verify whether peer-review manuscripts (and data products?) are aligned with publishing policies. 

        - [Open Science Metrics](https://dataseer.ai/open-science-metrics/): Using NLP to aggregate statistics on a variety of data points that include "open access licensing, data and code sharing, repository use, preprint posting, protocol sharing and reuse, personal identifiers, and more." The statistics can be reported according to different factors (e.g., journal, funder, over time, etc.) and linked back to originating sources (i.e., article and article metadata).

        - [DataSeer SnapShot](https://dataseer.ai/snapshot/): Using AI to determine the degrees to which journal article text describes open science practices and then generate messages to authors as to how they may address any gaps in describing their practices. The results help journal editors more accurately and efficiently quality check and triage articles for publication.

    - In addition to offering products, DataSeer engages in non-profit and academic [partnerships](https://dataseer.ai/2020/06/11/coko-receives-sloan-foundation-grant-to-build-dataseer-a-missing-piece-in-the-data-sharing-puzzle/) that promote open data and knowledge sharing via improved compliance, gaining workflow efficiencies, and achieving more insightful reporting.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

    - Based on its [publicly available Github](https://github.com/DataSeer), DataSeer employs ML and NLP.

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?

    - The field is an intersection of scholarly publishing, research and development, and technology. Terms that are used to describe this intersection, and nascent industry include, "Research Data Management (RDM)" and "Scholarly Communication" ([citation](https://doi.org/10.1080/13614533.2021.1964549)). These fields fall within a broader global movement for [Open Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science#/media/File:UNESCO-Open_science-pillars-en.png).

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?

    - More broadly, Open Science is a field that has grown over the last 10 years due to interlocking factors including: [local-to-global policy initiatives](https://doi.org/10.54677/MNMH8546) aimed at democratizing access to research knowledge and data; pushback to [peristent price increases for research journals](https://library.missouri.edu/news/lottes-health-sciences-library/scholarly-publishing-and-the-health-sciences-library#:~:text=The%20health%20sciences%20have%20been,of%20Missouri%20system%20pays%20now.&text=Why%20are%20journal%20prices%20increasing,bring%20journal%20prices%20under%20control.); and industry recognition that [Open Science may be good for business](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2023/11/open-science-6-reasons-businesses-should-pay-attention/). Yet less is known as to the size and scope of growth for either aspects of Open Science, RDM or Scholarly Communication.

* What are the other major companies in this field?

    - Online searches have not found direct competitors yet did find a host of AI-related companies in related spaces:
        - [Kopernio](https://ir.clarivate.com/news-events/press-releases/news-details/2018/Clarivate-Analytics-Acquires-Research-Startup-Kopernio-to-Accelerate-Pace-of-Scientific-Innovation/default.aspx) (acquired by Clarivate, 2018): AI that enables 1-click access to scholarly journals within institutional (academic) paywalls/firewalls as well as publicly available research.
        - [iNLP by integra](https://integranxt.com/inlp-ai-language-assessment/): AI/NLP for reducing the time and effort for editing scholarly journal articles.
        - [editage by Cactus](https://www.editage.com/): AI writing and editing assistants primarily directed at researchers/authors to optimize writing for paper pre-submission and post-submission.

    - It is highly likely that additional publishers, such as [Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies-and-standards/publishing-ethics-books/the-use-of-generative-ai-and-ai-assisted-technologies-in-the-editing-process), will either develop in-house solutions for AI to promote Open Science or partner with 3rd-party products and services, like DataSeer. DataSeer's partnerships with Taylor & Francis and IOP Publishing are examples of the latter. 

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

    - DataSeer seems to have been making inroads with, and having impact on, publishers and researchers. Funders and institutions may also be impacted. I could not find public data that indcate the degrees of business impact so far.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?

    - A primary core metric is gaining access to Open Science content through partnerships with key publishers who own the copyright to the content. Toward that, DataSeer has made made an inroad via its partnership with Taylor & Francis, one of the "big 5" publishers.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?

    - The data are lacking, particularly since DataSeer sits in such a niche market. There seem to be few players, let alone commercial, in this space.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

    - 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
